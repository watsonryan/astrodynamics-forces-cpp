# Validation Plan

## Stage 1 (Current)
- Analytic drag-equation unit tests
- End-to-end smoke test with deterministic exponential atmosphere

## Stage 2 (Integration)
- Adapter parity tests versus source model repos
- Cross-model consistency checks on shared scenarios

## Stage 3 (Operational)
- Golden trajectory drag acceleration regressions
- Performance budget checks in CI
